# Classroom Coding

## What

This is my repo for doing the exercise proposed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_tkIpwbsxY), the original repo is [here](https://github.com/DrBoolean/classroom-coding/tree/master)

It uses `react` for the rendering, `jQuery` for ajax, `Task` for handling the delayed effect and `Ramda` for functional utility.


## How to use

After installing visit http://localhost:5431 to see the blank slate app. If greeted with a snowy white page, you'll know you succeeded.

### Install

First run:

```
npm install
```

Then run each of these commands in a different terminal window. One for webpack, one for babel-node:

```
npm run dev
```

```
npm run server
```
